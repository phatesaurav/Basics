Quotes Inside Strings
With template literals, you can use both single and double quotes inside a string:
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h2>JavaScript Template Literals</h2>
    <p>With back-ticks, you can use both single and double quotes inside a string:</p>
    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
        let text = `He's often called "Johnny"`;
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;   // He's often called "Johnny"
    </script>
</body>

</html>
