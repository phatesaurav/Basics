    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
        let answer1 = "It's alright";
        let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
        let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';

            answer1 + "<br>" +  // It's alright
            answer2 + "<br>" +  // He is called 'Johnny'
            answer3;            // He is called "Johnny"
