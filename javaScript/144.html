<!--
Objects can also have methods.
Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.
this.firstName means the firstName property of this
this.firstName means the firstName property of person.
In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.
this is not a variable. It is a keyword. You cannot change the value of this.
In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.
In the example, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.
In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.
